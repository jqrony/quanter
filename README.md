## Features
### Multi Selector

The `Quanter` method allows for flexible element selection using a wide range of selector types:

- ✅ **CSS Selectors**  
  Supports tag names, class selectors (`.class`), ID selectors (`#id`), attribute selectors (`[attr=value]`), and pseudo-classes (like `:nth-child`, `:first-of-type`, etc.).

- ⚠️ **Limited XPath Support**  
  Basic XPath expressions are supported, but with limited syntax recognition. Use only for simple XPath needs.

**Best Use:** When your use case involves a mix of CSS-style selectors and simple XPath, and you want to avoid switching methods.

#### Signature and Parameters
```js
Quanter(String expr, DOMNode context, Array results, Array seed);
```

- `selector` [required] A CSS Selector or XPath Expression (comma separated or non-comma separated)
- `context` [optional] An element, document, or document fragment to use as the context for finding elements.
- `results` [optional] An optional array to which the matched elements will be added.
- `seed` [optional] A set of elements to match against

### XPath Selector

The `XPathSelect` method is a specialized function built to handle **full XPath syntax**, offering complete support for:

- Complex queries
- Nested expressions
- Axes like `following-sibling`, `ancestor`, `descendant`
- Functions like `contains()`, `starts-with()`, `text()`, etc.

**Best Use:** When your use case requires powerful and deeply nested element queries using the full capabilities of XPath.

#### Signature and Parameters
```js
Quanter.XPathSelect(String expr, DOMNode context, Array results, Array seed);
```

- `expr`[required] A XPath Expression (comma separated or non-comma separated)
- `context` [optional] An element, document, or document fragment to use as the context for finding elements.
